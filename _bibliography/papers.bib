  abstract = {Wholesalers economize on the fixed costs of forming direct buyer-supplier links but, due to scale-dependent entry barriers, can sustain markups that distort input prices and misallocate resources. I build a model of production network formation with endogenous direct vs.\ indirect trade, wholesale entry/exit, and markups. The model predicts that improvements in direct trade efficiency shrink the demand for intermediation, force marginal wholesalers to exit, and --- paradoxically --- increase markups among the surviving intermediaries, partially offsetting the efficiency gains from disintermediation. I test these predictions using Turkey's staggered fiber roll-out, instrumenting provincial connectivity with distance to the pre-existing oil-and-gas pipeline network (Demir, Javorcik and Panigrahi, 2023). Faster fiber growth lowers the indirect trade share, reduces wholesaler entry, and raises wholesale markups. Calibrating the model to the estimated elasticities implies that endogenous markup increases reduce welfare gains by about 1.4 percentage points --- roughly 30\% of baseline benefits. The results underscore the need to evaluate technology-induced disintermediation in general equilibrium, and highlight the role of complementary competition policies in realizing the full welfare potential of digital infrastructure investments.

  title  = {Internal Trade Barrier and Spatial Misallocation},
  year   = {2025},
  abstract = {I study how reductions in internal trade costs, driven by the rollout of fiber internet across Turkish provinces, reshape product-market competition and aggregate efficiency. First, I document a pro-competitive effect: provinces experiencing faster fiber rollout saw a relative decline in aggregate manufacturing markup, with markedly larger declines in sectors that are more tradable. Second, I develop a spatial extension of Atkeson–Burstein that embeds sectoral heterogeneity in tradability and internal migration. The model quantifies welfare changes that operate through two opposing forces. On the one hand, falling internal trade costs reduce aggregate markups and within-province markup dispersion. On the other hand, uneven infrastructure development can widen markup dispersion across provinces, misallocating workers toward low-markup provinces and dampening the aggregate gains. The net effect hinges on the initial spatial distribution of markups and on each province’s comparative advantage in more versus less tradable sectors. These findings provide a rationale for place-based policy aimed at correcting spatial distortions due to product-market power. The potential for uneven infrastructure development to worsen aggregate efficiency provides a rationale for a more balanced approach to development within a country.},

  year   = {2025},
  abstract = {When a few large importers internalize terms-of-trade effects, the standard optimal-tariff motive shrinks. Unlike granular seller power (Gaubert and Itskhoki, 2021), granular buyer power can eliminate the rationale for tariffs. This creates a complementarity between antitrust and trade policy: reducing importer concentration raises the optimal tariff by weakening private internalization of the terms-of-trade effect.},
